# Space Inavader

## Description

Our version of Space Invaders will be a reimagination of the arcade classic realised in Java. 
We take the simple gameplay formula of defending your base against an army of approaching 
alien spacecrafts and modernise it with new faster and smother gameplay, weapon upgrades, diverse 
and challenging enemy types and a brand new local multiplayer.
